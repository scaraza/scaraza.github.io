	<h2>SCENE IV</h2>
	<article>
<p>A street. <br>
<i>Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO. </i></p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Where the devil should this Romeo be? 

Came he not home to-night? </p>
<p>
<b>
Ben.</b>
Not to his father's; I spoke with his man. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline, 

Torments him so, that he will sure run mad. </p>
<p>
<b>
Ben.</b>
Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet, 

Hath sent a letter to his father's house. </p>
<p>
<b>
Mer.</b>
A challenge, on my life. </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Romeo will answer it. (10)</p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Any man that can write may answer a letter. </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Nay, he will answer the letter's master, 
how he dares, being dared. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Alas, poor Romeo! he is already 
dead; stabbed with a white wench's black 
eye; shot thorough the ear with a love-song; 
the very pin of his heart cleft with the blind 
bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to encounter 
Tybalt? </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Why, what is Tybalt? </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
More than prince of cats, I can tell 
you. O, he is the courageous captain of complements. 
He fights as you sing prick-song, 
keeps time, distance, and proportion; rests me 
his minim rest, one, two, and the third in your 
bosom: the very butcher of a silk button, a 
duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the very 
first house, of the first and second cause: ah, 
the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the 
hai! </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
The what?</p> 
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting 
fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 
'By Jesu, a very good blade! a very tall man! 
a very good whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable 
thing, grandsire, that we should be 
thus afflicted with these strange flies, these 
fashion-mongers, these perdona-mi's, who stand 
so much on the new form, that they cannot 
sit at ease on the old bench? O, their bones, 
their bones! <i>Enter ROMEO. </i></p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Without his roe, like a dried herring: 
O flesh, flesh, how art thou fishified! 
Now is he for the numbers that Petrarch 
flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a kitchen-wench; 
marry, she had a better love to be-rhyme 
her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a 
gipsy; Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; 
Thisbe a grey eye or so, but not to the purpose. 
Signior Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation 
to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit 
fairly last night. (50)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Good morrow to you both. What (50)
counterfeit did I give you? </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
The slip, sir, the slip; can you not 
conceive?</p> 
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Pardon, good Mercutio, my business 
was great; and in such a case as mine a man 
may strain courtesy. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
That's as much as to say, such a 
case as yours constrains a man to bow in the 
hams. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Meaning, to court'sy. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Thou hast most kindly hit it. (60)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
A most courteous exposition. </p>
<p>
<b>
Mer.</b>
Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Pink for flower.</p> 
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Right. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Why, then is my pump well flowered. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Well said: follow me this jest now 
till thou hast worn out thy pump, that when 
the single sole of it is worn, the jest may 
remain after the wearing sole singular. (70)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
O single-soled jest, solely singular 
for the singleness! </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Come between us, good Benvolio; 
my wits faint. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; 
or I'll cry a match. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose 
chase, I have done, for thou hast more of the 
wild-goose in one of thy wits than, I am sure, (79)
I have in my whole five: was I with you there 
for the goose? </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Thou wast never with me for any 
thing when thou wast not there for the goose. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
I will bite thee by the ear for that 
jest. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Nay, good goose, bite not. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; 
it is a most sharp sauce. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
And is it not well served in to a 
sweet goose? </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
O, here's a wit of cheveril, that 
stretches from an inch narrow to an ell broad! (89)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' 
which added to the goose, proves thee far and 
wide a broad goose. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Why, is not this better now than 
groaning for love? now art thou sociable, now 
art thou Romeo; now art thou what thou art, 
by art as well as by nature: for this drivelling 
love is like a great natural, that runs lolling up 
and down to hide his bauble in a hole. </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Stop there, stop there. (99)</p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Thou desirest me to stop in my tale 
against the hair. </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Thou wouldst else have made thy 
tale large. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
O, thou art deceived; I would have 
made it short: for I was come to the whole 
depth of my tale; and meant, indeed, to occupy 
the argument no longer.</p> 
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Here's goodly gear! <i>Enter Nurse and PETER.</i></p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
A sail, a sail! </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
Two, two; a shirt and a smock. (110)</p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Peter! </p>
<p><b>
Pet.</b>
Anon! </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
My fan, Peter. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Good Peter, to hide her face; for 
her fan's the fairer face. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
God ye good morrow, gentlemen.</p> 
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
God ye good den, fair gentlewoman. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Is it good den?</p> 
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
'Tis no less, I'll tell you, for the 
bawdy hand of the dial is now upon the prick 
of noon. (120)</p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Out upon you! what a man are 
you! </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
One, gentlewoman, that God hath 
made for himself to mar. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
By my troth, it is well said: 'for 
himself to mar,' quoth a'? Gentlemen, can 
any of you tell me where I may find the young 
Romeo? </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
I can tell you; but young Romeo 
will be older when you have found him than 
he was when you sought him: I am the 
youngest of that name, for fault of a worse. (130)</p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
You say well. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Yea, is the worst well? very well 
took, i' faith; wisely, wisely. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
If you be he, sir, I desire some confidence 
with you. </p>
<p><b>
Ben.</b>
She will indite him to some supper. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! So ho! </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
What hast thou found? </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a 
lenten pie, that is something stale and hoar ere 
it be spent. Sings. (141)
An old hare hoar, 
And an old hare hoar, Is very good meat in lent: 
But a hare that is hoar 
Is too much for a score, When it hoars ere it be spent. 
Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll 
to dinner, thither. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
I will follow you. </p>
<p><b>
Mer.</b>
Farewell, ancient lady; farewell, singing (151)

'lady, lady, lady.' <i>Exeunt Mercutio and Benvolio. </i></p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, 
what saucy merchant was this, that was so full 
of his ropery? </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
A gentleman, nurse, that loves to 
hear himself talk, and will speak more in a 
minute than he will stand to in a month. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
An a' speak any thing against me, 
I'll take him down, an a' were lustier than he 
is, and twenty such Jacks; and if I cannot, 
I'll find those that shall. Scurvy knave! I 
am none of his flirt-gills; I am none of his 
skains-mates. And thou must stand by too, 
and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure? </p>
<p><b>
Pet.</b>
I saw no man use you at his pleasure; 
if I had, my weapon should quickly have 
been out, I warrant you: I dare draw as soon 
as another man, if I see ocasion in a good 
quarrel, and the law on my side. (170)</p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Now, afore God, I am so vexed, 
that every part about me quivers. Scurvy k 
nave! Pray you, sir, a word: and as I told 
you, my young lady bade me inquire you out; 
what she bade me say, I will keep to myself: 
but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her 
into a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a 
very gross kind of behaviour, as they say: for 
the gentlewoman is young; and, therefore, if 
you should deal double with her, truly it were 
an ill thing to be offered to any gentlewoman, 
and very weak dealing. (182)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Nurse, commend me to thy lady and 
mistress. I protest unto thee-- </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell 
her as much: Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful 
woman. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou 
dost not mark me. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; 
which, as I take it, is a gentlemanlike 
offer. (191)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Bid her devise 

Some means to come to shrift this afternoon; 

And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell 

Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains. </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
No, truly, sir; not a penny. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Go to; I say you shall. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
This afternoon, sir? well, she shall 
be there. (199)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall: 

Within this hour my man shall be with thee, 

And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair; 

Which to the high top-gallant of my joy 

Must be my convoy in the secret night. 

Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains: 

Farewell; commend me to thy mistress. </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark, you, sir. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
What say'st thou, my dear nurse? </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say, 

Two may keep counsel, putting one away? (210)</p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel. </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest 
lady--Lord, Lord! when 'twas a little 
prating thing:--O, there is a nobleman in 
town, one Paris, that would fain lay knife 
aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief see a 
toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her 
sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer 
man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say 
so, she looks as pale as any clout in the versal 
world. Doth not rosemary and Romeo begin 
both with a letter? (221)</p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Ay, nurse! what of that? both with an R. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Ah, mocker! that 's the dog's name; 
R is for the--No; I know it begins with some 
other letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious 
of it, of you and rosemary, that it 
would do you good to hear it. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
Commend me to thy lady. </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Ay, a thousand times. <i>Exit Romeo. </i>(230)
Peter! </p>
<p><b>
Pet.</b>
Anon! </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Peter, take my fan, and go before, 
and apace. <i>Exeunt.</i></p>
