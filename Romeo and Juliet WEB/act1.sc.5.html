	<h2>SCENE V</h2>
	<article>
<p>A hall in Capulet's house. Musicians waiting.<br>
<i>Enter Servingmen, with napkins.</i></p>
<p> <b>
First Serv.</b>
Where's Potpan, that he helps 
not to take away? He shift a trencher? he 
scrape a trencher! </p>
<p><b>
Sec. Serv.</b>
When good manners shall lie all 
in one or two men's hands and they unwashed ytoo, 'tis a foul thing. </p>
<p><b>
First Serv.</b>
Away with the joint-stools, remove 
the court-cupboard, look to the plate. 
Good thou, save me a piece of marchpane; 
and, as thou lovest me, let the porter let in 
Susan Grindstone and Nell. Antony, and (11)
Potpan! </p>
<p><b>
Sec. Serv.</b>
Ay, boy, ready.</p> 
<p><b>
First Serv.</b>
You are looked for and called 
for, asked for and sought for, in the great 
chamber. </p>
<p>
<b>Sec. Serv.</b>
We cannot be here and there 
too. Cheerly, boys; be brisk awhile, and the 
longer liver take all. <i>Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house, meeting the Guests and Maskers.</i> </p>
<p><b>
Cap.</b>
Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes 

Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you. (20)

Ah ha, my mistress! which of you all 

Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty, 

She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now? 

Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day 

That I have worn a visor and could tell 

A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear, 

Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone: 

You are welcome, gentlemen! Come, musicians, play. 

A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls. Music plays, and they dance.


More light, you knaves; and turn the tables (30)

And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot. 

Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well. 

Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet; 

For you and I are past our dancing days: 

How long is't now since last yourself and I 

Were in a mask? </p>
<p>
<b>
Sec. Cap.</b>
By'r lady, thirty years.</p> 
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much: 

'Tis since the nuptial of Lucentio, 

Come pentecost as quickly as it will, 

Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd. (40)</p>
<p>
<b>
Sec. Cap.</b>
'Tis more, 'tis more: his son is elder, sir; 

His son is thirty. </p>
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
Will you tell me that? 
His son was but a ward two years ago. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
To a Servingman
What lady is that, which doth enrich the hand 

Of yonder knight? </p>
<p>
<b>
Serv.</b>
I know not, sir. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright! 

It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night 

Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear; 

Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear! 

So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows, (51)

As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows. 

The measure done I'll watch her place of stand, 

And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand. 

Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight! 

For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night. </p>
<p>
<b>
Tyb.</b>
This, by his voice, should be a Montague. 

Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave 

Come hither, cover'd with an antic face, 

To fleer and scorn at our solemnity? (60)

Now, by the stock and honour of my kin, 

To strike him dead I hold it not a sin. </p>

<p><b>
Cap.</b>
Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so? </p>
<p>
<b>
Tyb.</b>
Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe, 

A villain that is hither come in spite, 

To scorn at our solemnity this night. </p>
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
Young Romeo is it? </p>
<p>
<b>
Tyb.</b>
'Tis he, that villain Romeo. </p>
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone; 

He bears him like a portly gentleman; 

And, to say truth, Verona brags of him (70)

To be a virtuous and well govern'd youth: 

I would not for the wealth of all the town 

Here in my house do him disparagement: 

Therefore be patient, take no note of him: 

It is my will, the which if thou respect, 

Show a fair presence and put off these frowns, 

An ill-beseeming semblance for a feast. </p>
<p>
<b>
Tyb.</b>
It fits, when such a villain is a guest: 

I'll not endure him. </p>
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
He shall be endured: 

What, goodman, boy! I say, he shall: go to; (80)

Am I the master here, or you? go to. 

You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul! 

You'll make a mutiny among my guests! 

You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man! </p>
<p>
<b>
Tyb.</b>
Why, uncle, 'tis a shame. </p>
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
Go to, go to; 

You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed? 

This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what: 

You must contrary me! marry 'tis time. 

Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go: 

Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame! (90)

I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts! </p>
<p>
<b>
Tyb.</b>
Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting 

Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting. 

I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall 

Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall. <i>Exit.</i></p>


<p>
	<b>
Rom.</b>
To Juliet
If I profane with my unworthiest hand 

This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this: 

My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand 

To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss. (99)</p>

<p>
	<b>
Jul.</b>
Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much, 

Which mannerly devotion shows in this; 

For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch, 

And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too? </p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do; 

They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair. </p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
Then move not while my prayer's effect I take. 

Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged. (110)</p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
Then have my lips the sin that they have took.</p> 
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
Sin from my lips? O trespass sweetly urged! 

Give me my sin again. </p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
You kiss by the book. </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
Madam, your mother craves a word with you. </p>
<p><b>
Rom.</b>
What is her mother? </p>
<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
Marry, bachelor, 

Her mother is the lady of the house, 

And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous: 

I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal; 

I tell you, he that can lay hold of her 

Shall have the chinks. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
Is she a Capulet? (120)

O dear account! my life is my foe's debt. </p>
<p>
<b>
Ben.</b>
Away, be gone; the sport is at the best. </p>
<p>
<b>
Rom.</b>
Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest. </p>
<p>
<b>
Cap.</b>
Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone; 

We have a trifling foolish banquet towards. 

Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all; 

I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night. 

More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed. 

Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late: 

I'll to my rest. <i>Exeunt all but Juliet and Nurse.
(130)</i></p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman? </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
The son and heir of old Tiberio. </p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
What's he that now is going out of door? </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio. </p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
What's he that follows there, that would not dance? </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
I know not.</p> 
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
Go, ask his name: if he be married, 

My grave is like to be my wedding bed. </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
His name is Romeo, and a Montague; 

The only son of your great enemy. (140)</p>

<p>
	<b>
Jul.</b>
My only love sprung from my only hate! 

Too early seen unknown, and known too late! 

Prodigious birth of love it is to me, 

That I must love a loathed enemy. </p>

<p><b>
Nurse.</b>
What's this? what's this? </p>
<p>
<b>
Jul.</b>
A rhyme I learn'd even now 

Of one I danced withal. One calls within


'Juliet.' </p>
<p>
<b>
Nurse.</b>
Anon, anon! 
Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone. <i>Exeunt.</i></p>
